        <h3>F1 Testing, Day Two in Bahrain: Ferrari top timesheet as Carlos Sainz outpaces Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton</h3>
        <p>Carlos Sainz set the fastest time on the penultimate day of 2022's final pre-season test as Ferrari continued to show signs of real pace, once again beating rivals Red Bull and Mercedes in Bahrain.</p>
        <p>World champion Max Verstappen was second for Red Bull with Lewis Hamilton fourth for Mercedes, with the pair separated by Lance Stroll, who produced an encouraging display for Aston Martin.</p>
        <p>While Sainz himself warned on Friday that Mercedes could be holding back performance for next weekend's season-opener at the same circuit, Ferrari enjoyed another impressive day to maintain the form they've shown since Formula One's all-new cars were first revealed at a 'shakedown' in Barcelona two weeks ago.</p>

        <h3>Biden calls for suspending normal trade relations with Russia and will ban imports of vodka and seafood</h3>
        <p>(CNN)President Joe Biden on Friday called for suspending normal trade relations with Russia and said the US would ban imports of seafood, vodka and diamonds from the nation as part of an effort to ramp up economic pressure on Russia for invading Ukraine.</p>
        <p>Biden said the US, along with the G7 and European Union, will call for revoking "most favored nation" status for Russia, referred to as permanent normal trade relations in the US. The status means two nations have agreed to trade under the best possible terms, which can include lower tariffs, fewer barriers to trade and high imports, Biden said.</p>
        <p>The move requires approval from Congress and legislation is expected to be introduced following Biden's announcement.</p>
        <p>"Revoking PNTR for Russia is going to make it harder for Russia to do business with the United States and doing it in unison with other nations that make up half of the global economy will be another crushing blow to the Russian economy that's already suffering very badly from our sanctions," Biden said.</p>
        <p>The President said, "Many issues divide us in Washington, but standing for democracy in Ukraine, pushing Russia's aggression should not be one of those issues. The free world is coming together to confront Putin."</p>
        <p>The President also thanked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for being a "strong advocate" on this issue and for holding off on the legislation in the House of Representatives "until I could line up all of our key allies to keep us in complete unison."</p>
